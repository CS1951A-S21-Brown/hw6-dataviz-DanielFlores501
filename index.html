Written Questions:
1. My dashboard answers the Video Game Sales dataset. The first graph titled
"Top 10 Video Games of All Time" answers  the first question by displaying the
names of the top 10 games of all time according to that game's global sales.
Using a bar graph, the games with higher sales are
shown at the top while the smaller games are at the bottom.
The pie graph titled "Popular Genres in Region <region>" answers the second question
by showing what proportion of the pie a genre has in a selected region. Using the
interactive dropdown menu, the user can select a region to see what video games
are most popular there. Also, to improve readability the bottom 4 genres are grouped
together.
The second bar chart titled "Top Publishers of <Genre>" uses a bar chart to display
the global sales made by a publisher in a given genre. This answers the third question
by showing the top publisher at the top of the list with the largest bar, and
the following publishers below it. The dropdown menu allows the user to select a
genre they would like to see the sales and top publishers for.

2. D3 was useful as it provided a library of graphs to plot my data on, making the
data from the CSV into a presentable and easy to understand graph.
D3 also had functions to easily label my data dynamically, allowing for the Dashboard
to have interactive graphs. This helps to display the large amount of data in a
digestible way.
D3 helped with its library, specifically functions related to color. By handling the
spreading of colors across the data, D3 created possibilities to utilize color
schemes that are more readable for certain groups, making the data more accessible.

3. D3 would not be the best tool due to its limitations in the graphs it offers.
Although there is a wide spread of available stencils, data scientists could be limited
in how they display data.
D3 also would not be the best because of its data formatting expectations. When
managing larger, more confusing data sets, it might take a lot of processing to
shape the data into the format that some of D3's functions expect, such as domain
and range. In these cases, it might be better to use a coding language with more
complex list slicing.
D3 would not be the best tool if a scientists was trying to reach as many people
as possible with their data, due to the technological strain it has. Along with
the potential of being time inefficient, D3 or javascript is not supported on
older browsers. This means that people without the latest technology may not have
the same access to the data as others.

4. My dashboard is not very accessible according to the provided articles. Users
with tritanopia might have more difficulty reading the bar graphs, as they are
colored green and blue. At the time I did not realize this condition existed,
so I did not avoid it, but in the future I can avoid this and exclusively use
color schemes that are known to be readable to all. Users with other visual
impairments may also find it unaccessible, because the fonts used are small.
To remedy this I could look into what font sizes are necessary on computers
and phones to be legible to all. Furthermore, I appreciated the advice in one
of the articles that said to put white spaces between slices of a pie chart, as
the provided visual helped me understand why it would be difficult for some to
undestand otherwise. My pie chart lacked this and therefore might not be easy to
understand for some, so in the future I can add the whitespaces to make it more
accessible.

5. When deciding on the colors to use for my graphs, I could have researched visual
impairments that I should avoid and sought out a color scheme that would be
accessible. I also could have found information about how white space in a pie chart
helps make the data more accessible, and included it in my dashboard. Finally, I also
could have raised the size of the font to be easier to read. I did not take these
steps during my design process due to a time limiation for this project, my unfamiliarity
with D3's libraries, and my lack of knowledge on some visual impairments that make
my dashboard hard to read.
